## Usage
Configuring a library becomes as easy as just, and all publications will be set
```kotlin
plugins {                                    
    kotlin("js") // [kotlin("jvm")|kotlin("multiplatform")|kotlin("android")|kotlin("js)]
    id("tz.co.asoft.library")
}
```
After that you can just run `./gradlew publishPlugins` and you are all set
